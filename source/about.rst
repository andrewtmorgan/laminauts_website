The Layer fMRI Dinner Group is a collection of layer-fMRI researchers, trainees, methods developers, neuroscientists, and layer-enthusiasts (i.e. Laminauts), who organise regular dinner meetings.

Our aim is to provide a community-driven platform to discuss current issues, latest developments, and controversies in the field of layer-fMRI.

History of layer-fMRI dinners
-----------------------------

The first ever layer-fMRI meeting was a workshop organised by David Norris on October 22nd-23rd 2015 in Nijmegen.

The ISMRM study group Current Issues in Brain Function had dedicated their business meeting at the 2018 meeting in Paris on layer-fMRI. During this meeting, Ravin Menon proposed a community driven platform to deal with layer-fMRI challenges (keyword: repository of layer-fMRI repositories).

In November 2019, Cheryl Olman revived the notion of layer-fMRI workshops and organised a three day layer-fMRI workshop in Minnesota. During this meeting, it was agreed to maintain regular meetings as satellite events of the big international conferences (ISMRM, OHBM, SfN).

Luca Vizioli and Renzo Huber raised the funds to implement the first of this satellites in form of an invited dinner at the ISMRM 2020 in Sydney. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-pandemic, this ‘dinner’ was held as a virtual video conference call on May 7th 2020. With many succession events ever since.

We are also known as laminauts. A term that was established by Jonathan Polimeni, which is a play on toponauts by Eric Schwarz for people working on cortical topography, which in turn is a play on astronauts for people working in space.

Research focus of the layer-fMRI dinner group
---------------------------------------------

The primary focus of the layer-fMRI dinner group is the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of functional MRI data of layers and columns that are acquired in the human cerebral cortex. Structural layer-MRI, non-human layer-fMRI, or layers in sub-cortical structures are or tangential interest too.

Governing structure
-------------------

Everyone is welcome! As usual with community driven efforts, the person that puts the work in is the person that gets to make the decisions. If you have an idea about a layer-fMRI topic to be discussed, feel free to just organise it! If you have a new idea about a different form of layer-fMRI dinners, go ahead and implement it! The layer-fMRI dinner group will try to help.

Board members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on an insightful suggestion by David Norris, in 2020 we founded a board of the layer-fMRI dinner group. The purpose of the board is to advise on content and structure of layer-fMRI dinners and ensure diversity of speakers, as well as plan new types of events for the community. If you are interested in participating, just get in touch and join in!
