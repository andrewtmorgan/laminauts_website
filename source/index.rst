The Layer fMRI Dinner Group is a collection of layer-fMRI researchers, trainees, methods developers, neuroscientists, and layer-enthusiasts (i.e. Laminauts), who organise regular dinner meetings.

Our aim is to provide a community-driven platform to discuss current issues, latest developments, and controversies in the field of layer-fMRI.
