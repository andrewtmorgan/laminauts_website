First layer fMRI dinner: Layer fMRI Contrasts
=============================================

Overview
########


On May 7th 2020, there was the first virtual layer-fMRI dinner event to discuss current issues in the field.

This meeting was held as a replacement of an originally planned layer-fMRI dinner at ISMRM and happened in succession of an earlier in-person layer-fMRI dinner in November 2019 (`meeting minutes <http://layerfmri.com/2019/11/22/cdrf2019/>`_).

Below you find the important links of the the virtual event, videos of the talks and discussions, and a summary of the hot topics that were discussed.

- The meeting was organized by Luca Vizioli and Renzo Huber. And it was supported by CMRR (Essa Yacoub and Kamil Ugurbil) as well as the Maastricht-York partnership grant (PIs: Aneurin Kennerley and Renzo Huber).
- There were 149 participants + 4 speaker!
- The layerfMRI slack-channel of the network has been opened to everyone and can be joined `here <https://tinyurl.com/cdrfmri1>`_
- The content of the next meeting will be determined by results of a `survey <https://layerfmri.page.link/meeting_survey>`_. The meeting is scheduled for early July as of May 8th, it looks like most people prefer to talk about analysis challenges.

All slides can be downloaded `from zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3874364>`_.

Hot Topics Discussed
####################

- How do we estimate sensitivity and specificity of a sequence?
- Validations that layer-specific fMRI signals are explainable by electrophysiology are necessary.
- How important is it to consider arterial artifacts for layer-fMRI signal interpretation?
- How are inflow effects considered in different layer-fMRI readout schemes?
- Can maps of physiological noise be helpful for segmentation and/or registration?
- What do maps of non-gaussian noise represent?
- The major limitation of layer-fMRI is still the resolution! Can we go to smaller voxels? How?
- How can we make use to layer-fMRI in non-primary areas? And how applicable is it?
- How can we make use of layer-fMRI in pathology? E.g. vascular diseases.
- The combination of experimental setup and acquisition contrast is important.
- Layer-fMRI is depth-dependent fMRI.
